This is a project that is actively being updated. I have used Microsoft Excel to compile data on the portfolios of Vanguard and BlackStone. Following which, I coded these csv files into R and produced the graph that you can see within the repository that compares the BlackStone portfolio with the two Vangyard portfolios. The conclusions gathered insofar, are that when analyzing a portfolio's ESG compliance, it is important to first figure out what industries the portfolio is comprised of.
